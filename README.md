Welcome to `booters`! 
========================

This is a bootloader framework. It uses CPU architecture-specific crates, which are exposed as a unified API for generating customised bootloaders for various devices.

The main purpose of why this project was created was for multi-booting phones. At the moment, I'm targeting Mediatek and Qualcomm devices, with the aim of booting Linux or Windows 10/11. There will also be support for x86 MBR BIOS and x86_64 BIOS/UEFI in the future.
